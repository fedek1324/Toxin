text spacing b-color __description
used positon absolute in input block

split input block to dropdown and input?

interesting example: colors and type page
1) There are 2 spacers (flex inline blocks) who have
flex: 1 (= flex-grow: 1; flex-shink: 1; flex-basis: 0%;) - so it grabs all empty space of flex dlock
bcs other items have flex-grow: 0 by default so they dont grab empty space.

max-width: 125 px - for 1st and 415px for second - so they have max width

2) There are 2 blocks who have flex-basis: auto by defulat so it takes width which is content
width by deafult. So spacers start to shrink.
Second block has max width also

When any of 2 blocks start to shrink flex-wrap: wrap triggers. And also @media queries which set
flex-direction to column to spacers now invisible. and also @media adds margin-top to text types block



if in pug use
style
  include ../style.scss

then webpack dont track style.scss file changes and doesnt reload server



if images suddenly disappeared just rebuild

or

+b.b-form-elements-page
    link(rel='stylesheet', href=require('./form-elements-page.scss'))
    +e.DIV.e-container
        +e.DIV.e-colors-container

when there i make drowser dev console wider all by blocks start to became smaller (bcs some blocks have
width 100%) and even block with fixed width has started to became smaller so i set it min width and
it fixed everything (situation it type examples h1 h2 etc)
